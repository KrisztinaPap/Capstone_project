# Capstone Project - PuddleJumpers

## Introduction
- Your task is to solve a problem with a full-stack web application. The problem that you solve will be your choice, but you must define the problem and demonstrate how your application solves the problem in your documentation and your presentation. You can choose your own tech stack, but you must be able to complete the project so be sure to choose a stack you are familiar with. The reason we have chosen to give such a simple assignment definition is to allow you to be creative and also to give you enough time to focus on the details. This is your final capstone assignment and should represent a professional level of quality. It is your primary portfolio piece from this program.

## Project Summary
- Our web application simplifies usersâ€™ lives by enabling them to plan their meals for the next day or week in advance, using their own favourite recipes. By doing so, it reduces stress, decision-fatigue, and cuts down on last-minute grocery store trips

## Problem Statement
- Deciding on what to eat or what meal to serve the family three times a day can be a source of significant stress for many. We aim to provide our users with a convenient and easy-to-use repository for their favourite recipes and a way to organize them into daily or weekly meal plans. This could save them a lot of last minute decision-making, headaches about what ingredients they do or do not have on hand, and most importantly those energy- and time-consuming last minute trips to pick up that crucial missing ingredient.
