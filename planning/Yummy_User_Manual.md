## Quick Start Guide
Yummy allows users to plan their meals in advance, therefore saving them time and last-minute runs to the grocery store.

To properly install the application, please follow the steps described in the Yummy Installation Manual document or in the Yummy GitHub repository README file. 

### Main Yummy Features:
* Site Navigation
* User Profiles
* Meal Plan
* Recipes List
* Recipe Details
* Instructions/About Page


Yummy has a pop-out Site Navigation menu that can be accessed from any of the site’s pages by simply clicking on the button with the three horizontal lines (the “hamburger menu”) in the top left corner of the screen.


Yummy features an easy-to-use user profile management component and requires users to log in to ensure that recipes and meal plans stay private. 


For ease-of-use, the Meal Plan screen serves a dual purpose. It shows what is already scheduled and allows users to edit their plans.


The Recipes page displays all the user’s recipes for easy browsing. Clicking on a title or picture will bring up the details of that recipe. Clicking on the trash can icon will delete that recipe.


In the spirit of maximum user-friendliness and transparency, the Yummy landing page includes information on both the application and the team who built it.


### Main Features
#### Adding a Recipe
To add a recipe, just click on the menu in the top left corner (the “hamburger menu”) and choose Add a Recipe. There is an additional button on the Recipes page, for user convenience.
To add one of your own recipes, all you have to do is be signed into your account, choose ‘Add a Recipe’ from the menu, and start filling out the Recipe Information fields. 
The mandatory fields (ones you must fill out to be able to save your new recipe) are marked with * symbols.
Once you have reviewed your entry and are happy with it, just hit the Submit Query button at the bottom of the page. That is all!

#### Viewing Your Meal Plan
To view your meal plan, you can simply go to the menu in the top left corner of the screen (the “hamburger menu”) and choose the meal plan option.

Click on the recipe you want to add and then hold down your left mouse button and drag it over to your plan. You will be able to see the highlighting move as you hover over the individual meal slots.
