## TECHCareers: Capstone Project Plan
Meal-planning Web Application


## Team name: Puddlejumpers
Team Lead: Krisztina Pap

### Membership Roster:
* Aaron Barthel
* Lindsey Graham
* Kenji Au
* Tosin Olaniyi

### Project Summary:
Our web application simplifies users’ lives by enabling them to plan their meals for the next day or week in advance, using their own favourite recipes. By doing so, it reduces stress, decision-fatigue, and cuts down on last-minute grocery store trips.
The problem to be solved:
Deciding on what to eat or what meal to serve the family three times a day can be a source of significant stress for many. We aim to provide our users with a convenient and easy-to-use repository for their favourite recipes and a way to organize them into daily or weekly meal plans. This could save them a lot of last minute decision-making, headaches about what ingredients they do or do not have on hand, and most importantly those energy- and time-consuming last minute trips to pick up that crucial missing ingredient.
